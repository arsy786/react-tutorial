## Lesson 1 - Creating a React App

### <ins>Steps for creating a React App:</ins>
1. Need node installed. Check version with `node -v`. If no version, install using brew with `brew install node`.
2. Run command `npx create-react-app app-name` in terminal to bootstrap a starter react project in current directory.
3. Change directory to the newly created react project and run command `code .` to open current directory (starter react project) in VSCode.
4. To run react app in dev mode run the command `npm start` and the application will run locally at at localhost:3000.

### <ins>What does the starter React Project contain?</ins>
There are a series of folders and files within the starter react project.

node_modules:

- The node_modules folder contains all of the project dependencies, including the react library. Any packages or libraries installed in the future will always be stored in this location.
- If you were to delete this folder, the react app would not run. This is because all of the project dependencies are no longer present.
- You may notice that sometimes when you download a React project from GitHub... the node_modules folder is not present. This is because the node_modules folder is added to .gitignore as it is very large in file size (due to all the dependencies and libraries it contains). As a result, it is not included in many GitHub react projects to save time in downloading/uploading projects.
- If the folder is missing from a React App, in the project root directory run `npm install`. This command looks at the package.json file which decalares all of the project dependencies, and it re-installs them back into a node_modules folder!

public:

- The public folder contains all of the files that are public to the browser.
- The index.html file within the public folder is the entry-point of the react app in the browser. 
- All react code in injected into this 1 html file which is served to the browser. The exact location of this injection is in the div with id="root".

src:

- The src folder contains 99% of the code you will write in react.
- App.js is a react component which contains child components. 
- There are also other CSS and JS files within this folder.
- The index.js file is what kickstarts the application. It is responsible for taking all of the React components created and injected into App.js, and mounts them to the DOM within the id="root" div element in the index.html file that is in the public folder.

.gitignore:

- this file is used for version control with git and contains the files and folders you want to be ignored when comitting changes to the project and pushing these changes to the remote git repository.

package.json:

- this file contains all of the dependencies, scripts, and other configurations of the application/project.

package-lock.json:

- this file is essentially used to lock dependencies to a specific version number. This file is automatically generated (or re-generated) when there is a change in either the node_modules tree or package.json file.

README.md:

- this file is used for documentation of the project.

### <ins>What can we remove from the starter React App?</ins>
The starter react project comes with some default files that render the starter page but these can be deleted immediately to help cleanup the project for the development of our own app.

<ins>Files to delete</ins>

src:
- App.test.js, setupTests.js, logo.svg, reportWebVitals.js, index.css

public:
- All files except index.html

<ins>Code to remove/edit</ins>

src: 
- logo.svg import in App.js 
- reportWebVitals.js import in index.js
- index.css import in index.js
- clear the code inside of div in App.js (lines 6 to 19)
- convert App() function to arrow function in App.js
- keep App.css file but clear the clode.

public: 
- remove links to deleted files in index.html (line 5, 12 & 17) 
- remove comments in index.html
- change Title to something related to your project
